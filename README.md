# IOTC TCAC 13 - Allocation simulations

This document provides an overview of the preliminary assumptions and final outputs produced by the simulation of the allocation criteria defined in [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/11/IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02E_TCAC_draft_Allocation_Regime_v7_clean.docx) as developed by the [IOTC Secretariat](mailto:IOTC-Secretariat@fao.org).

## Configuration

The definition of all relevant parameters characterising each CPC with respect to the allocation criteria is provided in the [`CPC_CONFIGURATIONS.xlsx`](./CPC_CONFIGURATIONS.xlsx) file.

This includes two worksheets:

-   `CPC` - listing all current IOTC *contracting parties* (CPC) and *cooperating non-contracting parties* (CNCP) together with their:

    -   mnemonic code (generally the ISO3 code of the country)

    -   official English name (as an IOTC CPC)

    -   CPC / CPNC status

    -   *small islands developing state* (SIDS) status

    -   *coastal state* status

    -   presence of a *national jurisdiction area* (NJA) within the [IOTC area of competence](https://iotc.org/about-iotc/competence)

    -   size of the NJA (in km^2^, calculated from the shapefiles available to the IOTC Secretariat and originally downloaded from the VLIZ / Marine Regions [*maritime boundaries* database](https://www.marineregions.org/eezsearch.php))

    -   relative size of the NJA with respect to the IOTC area of competence.

-   `COASTAL_STATE_SOCIO_ECONOMIC` - listing all IOTC CPCs that are either a coastal state or have a NJA within the Indian Ocean, together with their development status (retrieved from [here](https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/WESP2020_Annex.pdf)), and a set of socio-economic indicators to address the requirements of both *Option 1* and *Option 2* in [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/11/IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02E_TCAC_draft_Allocation_Regime_v7_clean.docx) para. 6.6(1)(b).

    -   The indicators required by *Option 1*, i.e.:

        -   per capita fish consumption (kg / person / year)

        -   *Commonwealth Universal Vulnerability index* (CUVI)

        -   proportion of fish workers employed in small-scale and artisanal fisheries (%)

        -   fisheries contribution to GDP (%)

        -   proportion of total export value made up of fisheries exports (%)

        are not yet available to the IOTC Secretariat and have therefore been replaced by dummy values.

        > For this reason, caution should be made when assessing the results produced by the simulation through *Option 1*, and the IOTC Secretariat will update the required socio-economic indicators as soon as these will be provided by the proponents.

    -   The HDI (2021) and GNI indicators required by *Option 2* have been retrieved from the [UNDP](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI) and [WorldBank](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-group) websites, respectively, with the HDI index for the EU averaged from [here](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/human_development/European-union/).

### Assumptions

#### CPC / coastal state configuration

The identification of a CPC as *being* or *not being* an IOTC coastal state is still a matter of debate for some IOTC members that have NJAs within the IOTC area of competence.

> Having a NJA within the IOTC area of competence is a *necessary* (but *not sufficient*) condition for a CPC to be considered a coastal state.

For the sake of this simulation we assume the following:

-   That beside having an NJA in the Indian Ocean, `FRAT` (*France (OT)*) shall be *de facto* considered an IOTC coastal state (see [IOTC-2023-TCAC12-04](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/09/IOTC-2023-TCAC12-04_E_-_Chairs_Explanatory_Note.pdf) *Chair's explanatory memorandum to TCAC12 participants*).

-   That `EUR` (*European Union / REIO*) has an NJA in the Indian Ocean (i.e., the NJA around RÃ©union and Mayotte) and that for this reason "(...) *should benefit from an allocation that relates to the size of the EEZ of its outermost territories in the IOTC area of competence.*" (see [IOTC-2023-TCAC12-04](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/09/IOTC-2023-TCAC12-04_E_-_Chairs_Explanatory_Note.pdf) *Chair's explanatory memorandum to TCAC12 participants*).

-   That `EUR` (*European Union / REIO*), notwithstanding the above, "(...) *would not be seeking the application of paragraph 6.6(1)(b) of the coastal state allocation criteria (...)*" (see [IOTC-2023-TCAC12-04](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/09/IOTC-2023-TCAC12-04_E_-_Chairs_Explanatory_Note.pdf) *Chair's explanatory memorandum to TCAC12 participants*).

-   That there are different views as whether `EUR` (*European Union / REIO*) "(...) *should benefit from the portion of the coastal state allocation criteria related to aspirations under paragraph 6.6(1)(a) (...)*" (see [IOTC-2023-TCAC12-04](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/09/IOTC-2023-TCAC12-04_E_-_Chairs_Explanatory_Note.pdf) *Chair's explanatory memorandum to TCAC12 participants*).

> In lack of other indications, the simulation considers `EUR` (*European Union / REIO*) as benefiting from the portion of allocation specified by paragraph 6.6(1)(a) of [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/11/IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02E_TCAC_draft_Allocation_Regime_v7_clean.docx).

-   That clarity shall be made regarding the NJA sovereignty of the Chagos archipelago which iscurrently disputed between two IOTC CPCs (`MUS` and `GBR`) as this will have an impact not only on the attribution of the relative NJA area weight for the coastal state allocation criteria, but also on the status of `GBR` (*United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland*) as a coastal state itself.

> In lack of other indications, the simulation considers `GBR` (*United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland*) as having NJA sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago for the purpose of the quota calculation, and that this assumption does not qualify the CPC as a coastal state.

> Furthermore, `GBR` focal points have confirmed that they will request the application of paragraph 6.6(1)(a) and (c) of the coastal state allocation criteria, but not (b), and this has been properly reflected in the current implementation of the TCAC simulations made by the Secretariat.

#### Historical catches

This information is required to calculate the third component (*catch-based*) of the allocation criteria and can be downloaded from: [`HISTORICAL_CATCH_ESTIMATES.csv`](./HISTORICAL_CATCH_ESTIMATES.csv).

Historical catches are available for all years from 1950 to 2021 stratified by year, fleet, gear, school type, species, and assigned area.

It has to be noted how the need of apportioning historical catches by flag or fleet according to the area of operation (high seas vs. the NJA of any given coastal state) requires the IOTC Secretariat to estimate this information through a process that has been presented at the last TCAC meeting in October 2023, and agreed by the meeting participants.

For this reason, the historical catch series with full area breakdown is only available for the five major IOTC species (albacore, bigeye, skipjack, swordfish, and yellowfin tuna) and has been estimated using the regular grid vs. NJA overlapping area fraction as a way of assigning catches estimated for the former to the area that falls within a given NJA.

> At this stage of the process, there is no additional information from CPCs that might confirm whether their catches in a given grid shall only be attribute to the flag state or not. For this reason, the simulation uses the information in the `ASSIGNED_AREA` column of the historical catch series to calculate the anual catches for a given coastal state / flag state (when required).

For the sake of calculating the catch-based allocation weight for each CPC, information on historical catches is averaged across a selectable timeframe with two possible approaches that require to compute:

-   the annual average across the entire time period

-   the average of the best 'n' years across the time period

In the latter case, the *best years* are considered to be those with the highest catches across the selected period (for a given fleet / species).

# User Interface

The simulation is presented through an interactive web application developed using R-Shiny, and accessible through a [https://data.iotc.org/tcac/simulations/](dedicated%20web%20page) which is currently password-protected (credentials to be provided to the delegates participating to the TCAC).

The main screen presents two tabbed panels, one to display the reference data used by the simulation, and one to present users with all configuration parameters and the final simulation results.

## *Reference data* panel

This panel provides access to three main categories of configuration datasets:

-   ***CPC summary***, with the basic details for each IOTC CPC and CNCP and information on the NJA they might have in the IOTC area of competence
-   ***Coastal states summary***, with details of all IOTC CPCs that are either explicitly considered as coastal states, or that have a NJA within the IOTC area of competence. These include two distinct sets of socio-economic indicators to be used in agreement with the simulation requirements
-   ***Historical catches***, with estimated catches for the five major IOTC species stratified by year, flag, fleet, type of fishery, type of school association, assigned area, and species

All three datasets are presented as sortable, filterable tables and provide an interactive version of the configuration files included with the application.

## *Simulation results* panel

This panel provides access to the configuration parameters for the simulation and to the final outputs projected up to 10 years in the future (to take into account the transitional period in the allocation of catches from flag states to coastal states, when necessary).

### *Configuration parameters*

-   The **species** subject to the simulation (affects the catch records to be used to calculate the *catch-based* allocation component)

-   The **target TAC** in tons (affects the estimated annual TACs for each CPC and year)

-   The **main component weights**, i.e.:

    1.  The **baseline weight** - that doesn't require any further configuration as it assign an equal portion of the quota to each CPC (see [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/11/IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02E_TCAC_draft_Allocation_Regime_v7_clean.docx) para. 6.5)

    2.  The **coastal state weight** - that applies to all IOTC CPCs with a NJA in the IOTC area of competence (see [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/11/IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02E_TCAC_draft_Allocation_Regime_v7_clean.docx) para. 6.6 (1)), and that is further broken down into:

        1.  **Equal weight** (see [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/11/IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02E_TCAC_draft_Allocation_Regime_v7_clean.docx) para. 6.6(1)(a))

        2.  **Socio-economic weight** (see [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/11/IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02E_TCAC_draft_Allocation_Regime_v7_clean.docx) para. 6.6(1)(b))

            -   **Option #1**: *vulnerability + priority sectors + disproportionate burden* (see [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/11/IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02E_TCAC_draft_Allocation_Regime_v7_clean.docx) para. 6.6(1)(a)[OPTION 1]), which includes three distinct sub-weights to account for:

                1.  the **vulnerability** of the CPC (see [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/11/IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02E_TCAC_draft_Allocation_Regime_v7_clean.docx) para. 6.6(1)(a)[OPTION 1 (i)], whose main components (equally weighted at 50% each) are:
                    -   the **per capita fish consumption**
                    -   the **Commonwealth Universal Vulnerability index** (CUVI)
                2.  the **priority sectors** of the CPC (see [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](#0) para. 6.6(1)(a)[OPTION 1 (ii)], whose main components (equally weighted at 50% each) are:
                    -   the **proportion of fish workers employed in small-scale and artisanal fisheries**
                    -   the **SIDS** status (yes / no)
                3.  the **disproportionate burden** on developing CPCs (see [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](#0) para. 6.6(1)(a)[OPTION 1 (iii)], whose main components (equally weighted at 50% each) are:
                    -   the **contribution of the whole fisheries sector to the GDP**
                    -   the **proportion of total export value made up of fisheries export**

            -   **Option #2**: *HDI + GNI + SIDS* (see [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/11/IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02E_TCAC_draft_Allocation_Regime_v7_clean.docx) para. 6.6(1)(a)[OPTION 2]), which includes three distinct sub-weights to account for:

                1.  The **Human Development Index** (HDI) status

                2.  The **Gross National Income** (GNI) status

                3.  The **Small Island Developing State** (SIDS) status

        3.  **EEZ weight** (see [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/11/IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02E_TCAC_draft_Allocation_Regime_v7_clean.docx) para. 6.6(1)(c)) to replace the lack of indicators based on spatial stock abundance.

            > In this case, the size of the national jurisdiction area of a CPC within the IOTC area of competence is weighted according to its relative size compared to the latter.

    3.  The **catch-based weight**, to reflect the requirement that CPCs shall be eligible to receive such allocation based on the historical catches of the CPC **for each stock**. The criteria with which the historical catches are considered to determine this weight are indicated in [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/11/IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02E_TCAC_draft_Allocation_Regime_v7_clean.docx) para. 8, and the simulation tools allows to choose and configure:

        1.  The **historical catch interval**, which affects the determination of the average catches (see [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/11/IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02E_TCAC_draft_Allocation_Regime_v7_clean.docx) para. 6.8(1)(a))

        2.  The type of **historical catch average** to be considered (see [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/11/IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02E_TCAC_draft_Allocation_Regime_v7_clean.docx) para. 6.8(1)(a)), which shall be one among:

            -   ***Selected period*** - to calculate the average catch by CPC across the entire historical catch interval

            -   ***Best 'n' years*** - to calculate the average catch by CPC over the best 'n' years (in terms of catches) identified within the historical catch interval, with **number of years** as a selectable parameter

        3.  A stepwise approach (see [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/11/IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02E_TCAC_draft_Allocation_Regime_v7_clean.docx) para. 6.12) to implement the NJA attribution to coastal / flag states as per [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2023/11/IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02E_TCAC_draft_Allocation_Regime_v7_clean.docx) para. 6.8(2) over the course of 6 or 10 years, which is presented as a species-independent set of 10 coefficients that determine the fraction of catches from a flag state that are estimated to have been taken into the NJA of a CPC, and that shall be therefore assigned to the coastal state owning the NJA

            > Each coefficient represent the percentage of said catches that shall be attributed for that year to the coastal state. In theory, these coefficients shall represent a progression from a starting value \< 100% to 100% (all catches are attributed to the coastal state) but nothing prevents users to introduce whatever sequence they want for these coefficients.

### *Outputs*

The outputs of the simulation are presented as a table that has CPCs as rows and allocation years as columns (from 1 to indicate the initial year, up to a maximum of 10).

Each cell contains the quota assigned to the CPC for a specific year and depending on the choice of the **output unit** parameter it can be expressed either as a fraction (% of the TAC for a given species) or as an absolute value in tons.

Each cell has by default a background color whose intensity is directly proportional to the value within the cell, as compared to other cells / values within the same year or globally across the entire table.

The visual representation of the relative cell value can be changed via the **Heatmap style** parameter, which has two possible options:

-   **Background color** (default) to represent the (relative) cell value through the intensity of the background, or

-   **Bar** to represent the (relative) cell value through a horizontal bar.

The context in which the relative cell value is calculated can also be changed via the **Heatmap type** parameter, which has two possible options:

-   **Global** (default), to calculate each cell's relative value with respect to all values in the table, or

-   **By year** to calculate each cell's relative value with respect to all values estimated for the same year

Finally, the simulation results can be downloaded as an Excel file through the **Download** button. The name of the file corresponds to the serialized date (including the time) at which the download request was issued (e.g., `TCAC13_simulation_2024_02_01_150856.xlsx`), while its content includes the following five worksheets:

1.  `CPC_REFERENCES` containing the CPC configuration parameters as in [`CPC_CONFIGURATIONS.xlsx`](./CPC_CONFIGURATIONS.xlsx)
2.  `COASTAL_STATE_REFERENCES` containing the coastal states configuration parameters as in [`CPC_CONFIGURATIONS.xlsx`](./CPC_CONFIGURATIONS.xlsx)
3.  `HISTORICAL_CATCHES` containing the historical catches for the selected species as extracted from [`HISTORICAL_CATCH_ESTIMATES.csv`](./HISTORICAL_CATCH_ESTIMATES.csv).
4.  `SIMULATION_CONFIGURATION` containing all the configuration parameters set by the users for the specific simulation round
5.  `OUTPUT_QUOTAS` containing the outputs of the simulation expressed either as fraction of the annual TAC or as catches in tons by CPC and simulation year (depending on the chosen value of the **output unit** parameter)
