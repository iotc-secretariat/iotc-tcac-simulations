-   Default values of Total Allowable Catches (TAC): 80,000 t for bigeye tuna ([IOTC-2022-WPM13-10_Rev1](https://iotc.org/documents/WPM/13/10)), 630,000 t for skipjack tuna ([IOTC–2023–SC26–R](https://iotc.org/documents/SC/26/RE)), 300,000 t for yellowfin tuna ([IOTC-2023-SC26-ES04](https://iotc.org/documents/SC/26/ES04E)), 45,000 t for albacore ([IOTC-2023-SC26-ES01_rev1](https://iotc.org/documents/SC/26/ES01E)), and 30,000 t for swordfish [IOTC-2023-SC26-ES16_rev1](https://iotc.org/documents/SC/26/ES16E)

-   Limit the size ranges according to revised version of the simulation parameters ([IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF03_Rev1](https://iotc.org/documents/TCAC/13/Ref03)):

    -   **Baseline allocation**: 5-10%
    -   **Coastal state allocation**: 5-45%
    -   **Catch-based allocation**: 45-90%

<!-- # Technical changes -->

<!-- ## HISTORICAL_CATCH_ESTIMATES.csv -->

<!-- -   The term CPC actually regroups Members (CPs) and CNPCs, so the STATUS should not read "CPC" in the CPC dataset but MEMBER -->

<!-- -   Separate TWN from China -->

<!-- -   Add the code of the CPC/Observer (field CPC_OBS_CODE_SELECTED) for each fleet code -->
