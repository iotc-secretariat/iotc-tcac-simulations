## Simulation Tool {#simulations}

The Secretariat has developed an interactive simulation tool to facilitate the exploration of various configuration options for the components of catch allocation outlined in the Draft Allocation Regime (v7), presented at the 13^th^ session of the TCAC ([IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/documents/TCAC/13/REF02E)). The tool is an interactive R Shiny web application, available at [https://foodandagricultureorganization.shinyapps.io/iotc-tcac-simulations/](https://foodandagricultureorganization.shinyapps.io/iotc-tcac-simulations/). The App is password-protected to support access control and monitoring, with login credentials provided to participating delegates. To ensure full transparency and reproducibility, all scripts and data used to generate the Shiny App are available in the [iotc-tcac-simulations](https://github.com/iotc-secretariat/iotc-tcac-simulations) repository, hosted on the IOTC Secretariat's GitHub.

### Total Allowable Catch Values

The App allows users to set the TAC values, which are pre-filled by default in accordance with the most recent IOTC resolutions for bigeye and skipjack tunas, and with the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) values derived from stock assessments for albacore, swordfish, and yellowfin tuna:

- Albacore: 45,000 t  ([IOTC-2024-SC27-ES01](https://iotc.org/documents/albacore-tuna-0))

- Bigeye tuna: 92,670 t ([IOTC Res. 25/04](https://iotc.org/cmm/resolution-2504-establishing-catch-limits-bigeye-tuna-iotc-area-competence)

- Skipjack tuna: 628,606 t ([IOTC Res. 25/03](https://iotc.org/cmm/resolution-2503-establishing-catch-limits-skipjack-tuna-iotc-area-competence))

- Swordfish: 30,000 t  [IOTC-2024-SC27-ES16](https://iotc.org/documents/swordfish-1)

- Yellowfin tuna: 421,000 t  ([IOTC-2024-SC27-ES04](https://iotc.org/documents/yellowfin-tuna-1))

### Baseline Allocation

The baseline allocation refers to a percentage of the TAC for a given stock that is distributed equally among all current CPCs. In the App, users can adjust the baseline weight percentage, within a range of 0–100%, using an interactive slider in the application interface.

### Coastal State Allocation

Similarly to the baseline allocation, the total weight assigned to the coastal State allocation can be adjusted by users using an interactive slider in the application interface. This allocation component consists of three sub-components: (i) the equal weight, (ii) the socio-economic weight, and (iii) the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) weight. The contribution of each sub-component can be adjusted using interactive sliders in the App.

While two options for the socio-economic component were defined at the 13^th^ session of the TCAC ([IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/documents/TCAC/13/REF02E)), the indicators required for Option 1 are not yet fully available; therefore, only Option 2 is currently operational in the App (see [Appendix 2](#csFields) for details on the indicators).

The relative contributions of the three components of Option 2 -- the Human Development Index, Gross National Income, and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) status -- can be defined using interactive sliders, with their combined total summing to 100%.

### Catch-Based Allocation

The weight assigned to the catch-based allocation corresponds to the remaining percentage once the baseline and coastal State weights have been specified. To calculate the catch-based allocation weight for each CPC, historical catch data are averaged over a user-defined time frame using one of two computational approaches:
  
- the annual average across the selected time period; or
- the average of the best _n_ years across the selected time period, where the ‘best years’ are defined as those with the highest catches, within the selected period.

### Transition Period for Implementation

The TCAC proposed a stepwise approach for implementing the catch allocation scheme over a period of 6 to 10 years for each stock, through annual increments during this transition period. The App follows the schedule proposed in [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/documents/TCAC/13/REF02E) whereby each annual percentage value defines the proportion of the catch taken by foreign fleets in the NJAs that is allocated to the quota.
