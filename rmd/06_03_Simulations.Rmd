### Baseline Weight



### Coastal State Weight

For the purpose of the simulations and following the 12^th^ Technical Committee on Allocation Criteria [TCAC12](https://iotc.org/meetings/12th-meeting-technical-committee-allocation-criteria-tcac), the following points was considered in the simulations:

- The European Union / REIO (EUR) has an NJA in the Indian Ocean (i.e., the NJA around RÃ©union and Mayotte) and, for this reason, "*should benefit from an allocation that relates to the size of the EEZ of its outermost territories in the IOTC Area of Competence.*" (see Appendix 4, para. 2 of the [Report of the 12^th^ Technical Committee on Allocation Criteria](https://iotc.org/documents/TCAC/12/RE))

- Despite the above, EUR "(...) _would not be seeking the application of paragraph 6.6(1)(b) of the coastal state allocation criteria (...)_" (see Appendix 4, para. 2 of [Report of the 12^th^ Technical Committee on Allocation Criteria](https://iotc.org/documents/TCAC/12/RE))

- In their current configurations, the simulations considered EUR as benefiting from the portion of allocation specified by paragraph 6.6(1)(a) of [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/documents/TCAC/13/REF02E)

- In consultations between the IOTC Secretariat and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (GBR), GBR informed the Secretariat that para 6.6.(1)(b) would not apply to their case, but that paragraph 6.6.(1)(a) and (c) would.

### Catch-Based Weight

To calculate the catch-based allocation weight for each CPC, information on historical catches is averaged across a selectable time frame using two possible approaches that require computation:
  
- the annual average across the entire time period
- the average of the best "n" years across the time period

In the latter case, the 'best years' are defined as those with the highest catches during the selected period for a given fleet and species.
