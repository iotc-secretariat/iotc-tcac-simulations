# Purpose

This document provides an overview of the data, assumptions, and outputs generated by simulating the allocation criteria described in [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/documents/TCAC/13/REF02E). It also includes a brief description of the shiny application, along with explanations of the main configuration options for setting up simulations and interpreting the resulting outputs.
