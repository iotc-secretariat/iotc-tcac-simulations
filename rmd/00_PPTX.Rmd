# Purpose

To provide participants at the 25^th^ Session of the IOTC Working Party on Tropical Tunas (WPTT25) with a review of the status of the information on the three tropical species for the years 1950-`r LAST_YEAR` available to the IOTC Secretariat as of October 2022.

# Context (statistical year `r LAST_YEAR`)

- 16 IOTC species: ~`r pn(r_to(last_all_IOTC, 1e4))` t
- 3 tropical tuna species: ~`r pn(r_to(last_all_trop, 1e4))` t (~`r last_all_trop_perc`% of all IOTC species)

- [**Bigeye tuna**](https://www.iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/science/species_summaries/english/2_Bigeye2021E.pdf): ~`r pn(r_to(last_bet, 1e3))` t (~`r last_bet_perc`% of all tropical species)
    + Stock **not overfished** but [**subject to overfishing**]{.underline}
- [**Skipjack tuna**](https://www.iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/science/species_summaries/english/3_Skipjack2021E.pdf) : ~`r pn(r_to(last_skj, 1e4))` t (~`r last_skj_perc`%)

# Materials

- **[Retained catch data](`r NC_DATA_URL`)**: annual catch in live weight that is landed or transshipped, excluding all discards at sea;
- **[Catch and effort data](`r CE_A_DATA_URL`)**: monthly catch (in weight or number) and fishing effort (in gear-specific units) by spatial grid (unraised / raised to nominal catches, depending on the gears);
- **Size-frequency data**: individual body lengths or weights stratified by fleet, year, gear, type of school, month, and spatial grid;

---

# Materials (continued)

- **Discard data**: annual non-retained catch in live weight or numbers, including individuals released alive or discarded dead. _Should be raised to total discards_;

- **Observer data**: operational level data on fishing activities, vessel positions, catch estimates (level and composition), and gear configuration and fishing effort.

---

# Data processing

1.  **Controls and checks**: applied at reception of the data to ensure consistency with [IOTC reporting guidelines](https://iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/data/Guidelines%20Data%20Reporting%20IOTC.pdf);
2.  **_Best scientific estimates_**: re-estimation of species and / or gear composition for catch aggregates as well as for those fleets and fisheries characterized by well-known, outstanding issues in terms of data quality;
3.  **Raising of catch-effort geo-referenced data**: performed only for the five major IOTC species (ALB / BET / SKJ / SWO / YFT);
4.  **Filtering and conversion of size data**: data harmonized to EFL (LJFL for billfish) for all IOTC and major shark species.

---

# Definitions

IOTC data requirements vary with the size of the fishing vessels and their area of operation.

- **AFV** (_Authorized Fishing Vessels_): vessels of LoA > 24m or operating outside the EEZ of their flag state, authorised to fish for tuna and tuna-like species in the IOTC area
- **_Industrial_** fisheries: all fisheries operated by AFVs 
- **_Longline_** fisheries: industrial fisheries using longline gears
- **_Surface_** fisheries: industrial fisheries using gears other than longline
- **_Coastal_** fisheries: all fisheries operated by vessels other than AFVs, commonly referred to as **_Artisanal_** fisheries

  + Catches on FOB-associated schools show a generally increasing recent trend with the exception of **EU,Spain** in 2021
  
### Industrial longlines

  - Decreasing or stable trends after an increase in catches in 2020 that brought totals almost back to 2016 levels (**TWN**, **SYC**)

# Summary of fishery trends by fishery group

### Gillnet fisheries
  
  - Marked increases detected for **IRN** in 2021
  - All other fleets either stable (**LKA**, **IDN**) or in a decreasing trend (**PAK**)

# Summary of reporting quality - NC

- _Generally_ increasing trend in quality levels from 2010 (`r quality_nc[YEAR == 2010]$GOOD_PERC`%) to 2021 (`r quality_nc[YEAR == 2018]$GOOD_PERC`%), with a slight decrease from 2020 (`r quality_nc[YEAR == 2020]$GOOD_PERC`%, CoViD effect?)
- Reporting issues for several **coastal fisheries** 
    + **MDG**, **MOZ**, **TZA**, **IDN**: estimated by the Secretariat in recent years
    + **SOM**, **YEM**, **ERI**: complete lack of reporting
-	**PS** fishery of **EU,Spain** 
    + **changes in methodology** used to estimate species composition for 2018
    + Final figures **largely contrasting** with other segments of the same fleet 
    + Official updates from the EU **still pending**
    + Species composition for 2018 **re-estimated by the Secretariat**
- **PS** fishery of **Seychelles**: similar issues potentially detected for 2021

- Mix of _raw_ and _raised_ samples for some industrial PS fleets
- Minimum sampling criteria (1 fish / t) not always met
- Information is missing for several important artisanal fisheries, as well as for some industrial ones (longlines from **EU,Spain**)
