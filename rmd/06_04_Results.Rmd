## Simulation Results {#simulationResults}

The simulation results can be downloaded as an Excel file using the **Download** button in the 'Tables' tab. The filename corresponds to the date and time the download request was issued, formatted as a serialised timestamp (e.g., TCAC_simulation_2025_07_07_124531.xlsx). The file contains the following five worksheets:

1. 'CPC_REFERENCES' containing the CPC configuration parameters as in [CPC_CONFIGURATIONS.xlsx](./CPC_CONFIGURATIONS.xlsx)

2. 'COASTAL_STATE_REFERENCES' containing the coastal states configuration parameters as in [CPC_CONFIGURATIONS.xlsx](./CPC_CONFIGURATIONS.xlsx)

3. 'HISTORICAL_CATCHES' containing the historical catches for the selected species as extracted from [HISTORICAL_CATCH_ESTIMATES.csv](./HISTORICAL_CATCH_ESTIMATES.csv)

4. 'SIMULATION_CONFIGURATION' containing all the configuration parameters set by the users for the specific simulation round

5. 'OUTPUT_QUOTAS' containing the outputs of the simulation expressed either as fraction of the annual TAC or as catches in metric tonnes by CPC and simulation year (depending on the chosen value of the 'output unit' parameter).

Additionally, the 'Reports' tab allows users to download outputs as Word files, either for all CPCs simultaneously or individually for each entity via a drop-down list. The reports include an initial table presenting the general scenario configuration, followed by the final results after a 10-year transition period, as well as allocation and TAC values calculated at each step of the allocation process: (i) baseline allocation, (ii) coastal State allocation including all sub-components, and (iii) catch-based allocation.
