# Input Data {#inputData}

## CPC Status and Characteristics

The definitions of all parameters characterising each CPC in relation to the allocation criteria are provided in the Excel spreadsheet  [CPC_CONFIGURATIONS.xlsx](./CPC_CONFIGURATIONS.xlsx) file. This file contains two worksheets:
  
- The 'CPC' worksheet lists all current IOTC Contracting Parties (CPs), Liberia as a Cooperating Non-Contracting Party (CNCP), and Taiwan,China as a Fishing Entity (FE). It includes information on CPC status, classification as a Coastal State or Small Island Developing State (SIDS), and the presence and size of National Jurisdiction Areas (NJAs) within the IOTC Area of Competence

- The 'COASTAL_STATE_SOCIO_ECONOMIC' worksheet includes all CPCs identified as Coastal States, along with their development status and a set of socio-economic indicators aligned with the requirements of Option 1 and Option 2 under paragraph 6.6(1)(b) of [IOTC-2024-TCAC13-REF02](https://iotc.org/documents/TCAC/13/REF02E).These indicators are used to simulate allocation scenarios that incorporate development and vulnerability criteria.

Detailed descriptions of the fields included in these two worksheets are provided in [Appendix 1](#cpcInformation) and [Appendix 2](#csFields), respectively.

## Historical Catches {#historicalCatch}

Historical catch data for albacore, bigeye tuna, skipjack tuna, swordfish, and yellowfin tuna are available from 1950 to 2021. These data can be downloaded from [HISTORICAL_CATCH_ESTIMATES.csv](./HISTORICAL_CATCH_ESTIMATES.csv) and opened using spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc, Google Sheets, or any standard text editor. Detailed description of the fields included in the file is provided in [Appendix 3](#catchFields).

Catch data are stratified by year, fleet, gear, school type, species, and assigned area (either a National Jurisdiction Area or the high seas) to support allocation analyses. The method used to categorise catches by area of operation was presented to the Technical Committee on Allocation Criteria at its twelfth meeting in October 2023 and endorsed by participants ([IOTC-2023-TCAC12-INF02](https://iotc.org/documents/TCAC/12/INF02)). For longline and surface fisheries operating on the high seas, catches were allocated to NJAs based on the proportion of spatial overlap between each regular grid cell and the corresponding NJA (see [IOTC–2017–SC20–INF05](https://www.iotc.org/documents/estimation-eez-catches-iotc-database)).

The National Jurisdiction Areas (NJAs) of IOTC CPCs were sourced from the Flanders Marine Institute's [Maritime Boundaries Geodatabase](https://doi.org/10.14284/628). These shapefiles are available for download from the [IOTC Reference Data Catalogue](https://data.iotc.org/reference/latest/domain/admin/shapefiles/IO_NJA_AREAS_1.0.0_SHP.zip). For historical reasons, the waters of the Chagos Archipelago were considered to be under the sovereignty of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (GBR).
